# INFO 550: Solving LSAT Logic Games using Propositional Logic and Backtracking

## Files
- `product_code.py`, `films.py` and `recycle.py` store the code that build the KB and variables.
- `solver.py` is the main script. Run this file in the command line with one of the following arguments - e.g., `python solver.py [-g1, -g2, -g3] [-backtrack, -fwdcheck]. Will print out the valid assignments found through backtracking, and how long it took to run.
